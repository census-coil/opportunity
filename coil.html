        <h2>What is the Census Open Innovation Labs?</h2>
        <p>Census Open Innovation Labs (COIL) is a nimble, startup-like team within the U.S. Census Bureau with a
          portfolio of projects that are setting a standard for open innovation across government. </p>
        <p>COIL leverages the networks, talents, and expertise of companies, organizations, and individuals
          outside our own walls to deliver on two key objectives:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>increasing American prosperity by disseminating federal open data, and</li>
          <li>increasing response rates for the 2020 Census, particularly among communities
            considered “hard to count”— those historically yielding low response rates.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>COIL’s open innovation strategies include ideation workshops, user-centered design, user experience
          research, technology development sprints, prize competitions, crowdsourcing, and creative partnerships.
          These initiatives solve major national problems by engaging a diverse ecosystem of stakeholders from
          the tech, media, and entertainment industries; federal, state and local government; nonprofit organizations,
          advocates, local communities, and more.</p>

          and the public at large through user-centered design, data, creative media, and technology. </p>

              <h3>The Opportunity Project</h3>
              <p>The Opportunity Project (TOP) is a technology accelerator program that brings together the tech
                industry, government, and communities, to generate digital products that benefit the public and drive
                the economy by using federal open data. TOP works through 12-week tech development sprints, facilitated
                by COIL, to drive new digital solutions that leverage federal, state and local open data to directly
                serve families, local leaders, and businesses and communities at large. To date, 80 products have been
                created through TOP, addressing problems like the opioid crisis, disaster response, veterans’
                employment, and more.

            <h3>Census Accelerate </h3>
            <p>Census Accelerate is an initiative that matches creative talent with organizations serving
              hard-to-count communities in order to increase 2020 Census response rates. Like The Opportunity Project,
              Census Accelerate works in user-centered sprints and workshops in which participating companies,
              organizations, creative professionals, and influencers develop outreach materials for specific
              hard-to-count populations, such as families with children under the age of 5, mobile millennials, and
              LGBTQ populations.

              <h3>User-Centered Design Training Program</h3>
              <p>User-Centered Design is a critical approach to creating effective, user-friendly products and services
                by putting people first. COIL trains federal staff and leadership in user-centered design and design
                thinking as a means of creative problem solving to yield better outcomes, increase cost savings, improve
                customer engagement, and reduce burden on data users and the public. This program infuses the day-to-day
                business of the Census Bureau with a new approach to engaging stakeholders across various fields,
                industries, as well as the government sector, helping to make the Census Bureau a benchmark leader in
                user experience and citizen services.
